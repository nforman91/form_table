I realized after the assessment that the logic had to be done in the parent component, and passing props down to child components. Additionally, I fixed the sorting logic and the final product is quite similar to the prompt.

This is the App.js and App.css files that I made from scratch based on the prompt from the assessment. Please let me know if you want any clarification. Thank you!
